### Firebase Authorization - React + Tailwind + Reach Router

**React + Firebase using Hooks and Firestore

This project follows the [LogRocket React + Firebase Auth](https://blog.logrocket.com/user-authentication-firebase-react-apps/) from a blank Create React App.

## Motivation

After cloning, modifying, and deploying multiple React + Firbase apps, I wanted to build one from scratch using Create React App. My goal is to practice my git commit flow while helping to ingrain the process of deploying a secure React + Firebase app to memory.


## Installation
